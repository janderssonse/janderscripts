# Janderscripts

A mixed collection of small helpers and scripts, mostly for use by myself, but maybe someone else will find something of worth.

## Dependencies

These have most likely only been tested in an Linux environment.

For the Bash scripts, in some cases there will be a [Bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) test.

##

- bash/src/reuse_addheader_filetree.sh - A wrapper for the addheader function of the [REUSE](https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool) project.
