# Janderscripts

A mixed collection of small helpers and scripts, mostly for use by myself, but maybe someone else will find something of worth.

## Dependencies

These have most likely only been tested in an Linux environment.

For the Bash scripts, in some cases there will be a [Bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) test.
